# Implementing a CNN for finger counting 

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the finger counting. 

## The dataset
The chosen dataset is composed of pictures of hands describing a number. The goal of this CNN is to count the number of fingers that we can count thanks to image recognition.
